# Agent Guardrail Skill — Implementation Plan

A guardrail system for coding agents targeting **Claude Code and GitHub Copilot
as co-equal, immediate targets**, for TypeScript and Java projects (single-repo
or monorepo). Open-source tooling only. Three layers:

1. **`guardrails-core`** — an npm package (CLI: `guardrails
verify|autofix|audit|gate|state|scope-check|session-*`) holding all
   machinery. Installed as a repo devDependency; the single thing every runtime
   calls.
2. **A thin Claude Code plugin** — hooks wiring, the two fixer agents, and the
   scaffolding skill. Provides the full delegation loop on Claude Code.
3. **Per-repo policy + state** — configs, thresholds, `.claude/state/`,
   `.github/hooks/*.json`, CI workflow. Written by the scaffolder, checked in.

Built **solo-first but designed for team**: the solo→team transition is a config
flip plus a publish, not a rewrite.

The authoritative, full design lives in the conversation that produced this
repo. This file captures the load-bearing decisions and the phase plan so the
repo is self-describing.

## Normalized violation contract (the linchpin)

```ts
interface Violation {
  ruleId: string; // stable, namespaced: "ts/no-assertionless-test"
  file: string; // repo-relative
  line?: number;
  message: string;
  severity: 'error' | 'warn';
  fixable: boolean; // true → silent PostToolUse autofix class
  tool: string; // "eslint" | "tsc" | "knip" | ... | "guardrails"
  package?: string; // workspace/module id in monorepos
}
```

Recurrence memory keys on `package:ruleId` in workspace layouts.

## Control loop

Stop hook (main agent only, never agent frontmatter) → `verify` (diff-scoped) →
clean/delegate/escalate. Bounded attempt counter (no `stop_hook_active`
shortcut). Fixer is a restricted subagent (Read/Edit/Write, no Agent/Task, no
Bash) that reads the manifest into _its own_ context. Guards that hold
regardless of model tier: the **diff-auditor** (snapshot-based, rejects added
suppressions/casts/skips), **no-deletion** (fixer comments-and-flags), **hidden-
fix logging**, and **recurrence-as-signal** auto-promotion.

Model ladder: attempts `1..MAX-1` → fast fixer; final attempt → thorough fixer;
exhausted → main agent (top model, full context). Loose classes (architecture,
mutants, logic-revealing type errors, maybe-live dead code) route to the
thorough tier from attempt 1 — a **safety** mechanism, not an optimization.

## Cross-runtime map (Phase B)

Claude Code gets the full Stop-loop. On Copilot surfaces Stop is observational,
so the analog is a **PreToolUse commit/push gate** (`guardrails gate
--mode=commit`), plus a git-native `.githooks/pre-commit` (catches human commits
the agent hooks can't see). CI runs the same `verify` as the authoritative,
only-guaranteed gate.

## Build phases

- **A — guardrails-core + Claude Code loop, TS + single-repo.** ← _this branch_
- **B — Copilot channel** (all three surfaces: VS Code, CLI, cloud agent) +
  git pre-commit + CI.
- **C — TS pack complete + workspaces** (knip, dependency-cruiser, semgrep,
  stryker in CI; affected-package scoping).
- **D — Java pack + polyglot** (spotless, pmd, error-prone/nullaway, spotbugs,
  ArchUnit, pitest/descartes; Maven/Gradle report adapters).
- **E — Scaffolder + team-flip** (detection/plan/confirm/idempotency skill;
  solo→team config flip).

## Solo → team

`guardrails.config.json` carries `distribution: "solo" | "team"` and
`enforcement: "warn" | "block"`. The flip: commit `recurrence.json`, make CI a
required check, publish core + plugin, standardize thresholds — no code changes.

## Phase A status

Built and tested (Vitest, strict TS → ESM): the `Violation` contract, session
plus cross-session recurrence memory with persistence, the diff-auditor, the
verify orchestrator with eslint/tsc adapters and diff-scoping, the gate decision
engine with snapshot-based composition, the full CLI, and the thin Claude Code
plugin with two scope-locked fixer agents. See `README.md` and
`docs/live-loop-verification.md`.
